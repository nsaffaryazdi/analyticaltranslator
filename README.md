"Analytical Translator" is a translator project that comprises a collection of open source natural language functions
and resolves many natural languages problems in order to provide an analytical translation. This software is able to
analyze sentences, correct syntax and grammar and report and explain mistakes. It aims to be a pedagogical translation
tool for language learners and it is able to correct gender, conjugation and declination discrepancies as well as some
ortographic rules.
